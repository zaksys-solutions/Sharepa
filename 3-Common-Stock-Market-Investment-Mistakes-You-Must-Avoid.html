				<p class="BlogDate">16 June, 2021</p>
				<img src="img/Blog-9.jpg" style="width: 100%;margin-bottom: 30px;">
				<div class="blogContent">
					<p>There are many <a href="Top-stock-market-investment-myths.html" style="color: #440197!important;">myths about stock markets</a> spread across the world which we have covered in one of our blogs. On the other side, we all know how important it is for us to have a second source of income and what better way to do that other than investing in the stock market. You can also go through other <a href="Reasons-you-must-start-investing-in-stock-market-today.html" style="color: #440197!important;">benefits of stock market investment</a> in our previous blog. The idea of beating inflation and earning extra income to reach our financial goals sooner makes us want to invest in the stock market.</p>
	                <p>Moreover, who doesn’t get dazzled by the idea of multiplying money? Everyone does; which is exactly why most people use such words in the advertisements to catch attention. However, before investing in the stock market, you must spend a lot of time researching and studying. Most people end up missing this most important step and make a lot of other mistakes during their first stock market investment. </p>
                  <p>Apart from the inadequate research, we will list such commonly made stock market investment mistakes by newbies so that you take extra care and do not repeat the same mistakes:</p>
	            </div>
	            <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>Lack of Planning</b></p>
                <p>One of the most commonly made mistakes by first-time investors is to blindly trust the stocks that seem to be performing well. Unfortunately, guessing games do not work when it comes to stock market investment. Not having a goal in mind and a plan in place can result in losses. One way to keep yourself away from this mistake is to identify your goals, devise a strategy and chart out a financial plan before investing. If you have facts and figures in mind, you will be able to make an informed decision.</p>
               <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>Chasing returns</b></p>
                <p>What do you take into account when you choose a stock to invest in? Please do not say ‘returns’. Chasing returns is one of the most common mistakes that most people make. Do not invest in a stock just because it is giving high returns at that particular time. It is not certain that it will give the same returns even in the future. Before investing in a stock, you must go through a lot of things apart from its returns. You should deeply study the company, its long-term objectives, it’s business model and a lot more. All these factors make a great impact on stock movement.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>Neglecting diversification</b></p>
                <p>Putting all your eggs in one basket is one of the most commonly made investment mistakes too. If you invest in stocks of only one company or industry, you are under high risk. What if that stock does not perform well? You are at risk even if you are investing only in stocks. In order to mitigate risks, you must invest in multiple asset classes like stocks, mutual funds, fixed deposits, gold, real estate, and more. Also, if you are buying stocks, you must diversify and buy stocks in different companies of different industries.</p>
                <p>Now that you are aware of some of the most commonly made mistakes made by the first-time investors, ensure you do not commit the same mistakes.
