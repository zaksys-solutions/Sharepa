	            <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>1. Disciplined investing</b></p>
                <p>SIPs play a crucial role in making you a disciplined investor. Now, you need not worry about not investing regularly, as the amount chosen by you gets automatically debited from your account which in turn is invested in your mutual fund scheme.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>2. Convenience</b></p>
                <p>SIP is an easy-going process. All you have to do is enable auto-debits from your bank account and let the technology do the needful. With this facility available, you don't have to worry about physically reaching out to the bank to transfer your investment amount.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>3. Power of Compounding</b></p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>4. Flexible</b></p>
                <p>Since SIPs are very flexible, they provide you with the best available option to increase and decrease the SIP amount at any given point of time. Apart from this, it also allows you to start a new SIP in the same scheme or in any other scheme of your choice.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;"><b>5. Pocket friendly</b></p>
