So without any further delay, here we go...</p>

	            <p style="margin-bottom: 3px;font-size: 20px;"> <b>Online trading account: Need of the hour!</b></p>
                <p>In order to trade, every trader needs an online trading account, as it allows you (investors) to set trading limits and execute trading faster. Apart from the fact that you need a trading account to buy and sell shares online, there are many other reasons you need it. You can get access to multiple stock exchanges and financial reports. You can also track your profitability online and enjoy seamless transactions and customisable experience.  </p>
                <p>To know more, let us take a look at some of the advantages of having an online trading account in India. </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3px; margin-top: 25px;font-size: 20px;"> <b>Benefits of an online trading account</b></p>
                <p><b>1. Ease of accessibility:</b></p>
                <p style="margin-top: -12px;"><b><i>Trade from multiple stock exchanges through a single platform</i></b></br>
				Trading in multiple stock exchanges seemed next to impossible during old days when people used to visit the stock exchange physically to trade. However, with an online trading account, you can trade through multiple stock exchanges through a single platform; be it BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange), NSE (National Stock Exchange), MCX (Multi Commodity Exchange) or NCDEX (National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange).</p>
				<p><b>2. Staying up-to-date:</b></p>
                <p style="margin-top: -12px;"><b><i>Get latest news, reliable information that helps you make an informed decision</i></b></br>
				Correct information, latest happenings of what’s going on in the market, some facts and numbers, research reports created by the expert professionals etc. are some of the most important things that will help you make right decisions for your trade. These reports and information are often given by your service providers, which drastically increase the chances of earning high profits.</p>
				<p><b>3. Multi-device support:</b></p>
                <p style="margin-top: -12px;"><b><i>Trade on-the-go from multiple platforms</i></b></br>
				Online trading has reached a level of unparalleled convenience by letting us trade from anywhere at any time. You can trade from your app on your smartphone or from your desktop or laptop on a website or from any other hand-held device. Can it be easier to buy/sell shares onlines and keep track of your investments?</p>
				<p><b>4. Customised trading experience:</b></p>
                <p style="margin-top: -12px;"><b><i>Personalise your experience using technology, strong customer service and notifications</i></b></br>
				You can now transform the way you see your orders or watchlist on your trading platform; thanks to advanced technology! You can now customise your entire experience as per your requirements. In case you get stuck anywhere, the answer to your queries are just a call or a mail away. A strong customer support team is at your rescue.
