					<p>Are you willing to start investing in the stock market? Look no further. You have landed up on the right page!</p>
	                <p>However, in order to start investing, you need a trading account and before that you must know the <a href="What-is-a-trading-account.html" style="color: #440197!important;">basics of trading</a> as well as the <a href="Trading-account-Need-and-Benefits.html" style="color: #440197!important;">benefits of trading account.</a></p>
	                <p>Once you know these things, you must <a href="Things-to-Consider-Before-Choosing-a-Stock-Broker-in-India.html" style="color: #440197!important;">choose your stock broker wisely</a> and then you can open an account and start investing.</p>
	                <p>But before embarking on your investing journey, you must educate yourself. If you are someone who wants to enter the market and prevail, you must master the basic trading skills. </p>
	                <p><b>Here are some of the best trading tips for beginners:</b></p>
	            </div>
	            <p><b>1.Decide the trading amount: </b></br>
                Most people who have been successful in trading keep aside 1-2% of their balance. As a beginner, you must not risk more than 0.5% of your money for trading in the stock market. Whatever the amount may be, the first step is to pre-determine the amount. </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><b>2. Determine the time too: </b></br>
               All the investors need time. However, the beginners need even more time. You have to understand the terminologies and concepts; you have to research and understand how the market works. You have to analyse stocks and learn from others mistakes. You have to do a lot of things before you actually start investing and even during the first few months. </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><b>3. Starting small is the key: </b></br>
                As a beginner, you must start investing in only a couple of stocks. You may be tempted to be a part of a lot of your favourite brands. But, do not go with your emotions. Try to keep calm and start small. Once you get a hang of it, you can increase the amount. </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><b>4. Stay up-to-date: </b></br>
                The pace at which the world is changing right now is unbelievable. You have to stay abreast of the latest happenings that can fluctuate the market. Read news related to the industries of the companies you have invested in or are interested to invest in. </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><b>5. Do not borrow:</b></br>
                This is our all-time favourite tip. It is not advisable to borrow money from someone else just to invest in the stock market. You invest only if you have your own money. This will help you avoid the losses. </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><b>6. Do not follow the trends blindly: </b></br>
                Most young investors who do not have sufficient knowledge follow the market trends and influencers on social media blindly. While it is a great thing to expand your knowledge, your decisions should not be completely dependent on them. Do your own research and analysis. </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><b>7. Keep realistic expectations: </b></br>
                While the internet is filled with stories of people who have earned a lot of money from the stock market, you must know that this is rare. Also, not everyone earns equally. There are many factors that affect your profits or losses. Usually, investing in the stock market gives you 12-25% returns over long periods of time. However, the stock market is unpredictable, and you have to set your expectations accordingly. </p>
